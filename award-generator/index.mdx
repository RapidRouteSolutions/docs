## Create Your Account

To begin, sign in using your Google account or create a new account with your email address.

Once logged in, you'll receive **5 free credits** to explore the Award Generator's capabilities and see how it can simplify the process of generating military award citations. Your remaining credits will be displayed in the top right corner of your dashboard.

## Generate Your First Award Citation

1. From your dashboard, click on the **"Award Generator"** option in the left sidebar menu.

2. On the Award Generator page, select your **branch of service** from the dropdown menu.

3. Fill in the following details:

   - **Rank**: Enter the rank of the individual.
   - **Name**: Enter the name of the individual.
   - **Unit**: Enter the unit of the individual.
   - **Duty Title**: Enter the duty title of the individual.
   - **Time Period**: Enter the award period.
   - **Accomplishments**: Describe the individual's accomplishments in detail.

4. Select the **format** for your award citation, such as Achievement Medal, Commendation Medal, etc.

5. Click **"Generate"** and the Award Generator will create a personalized award citation based on your input.

**Note:** Due to the increased complexity and increased word count, the award generator takes **3 credits per submission**.

**Tip:** Avoid using uncommon acronyms as the AI might not recognize them. It's best to spell out terms explicitly, as awards generally do not contain acronyms. This will ensure the best results.

That's it! You can view your previously generated awards anytime by clicking the **"Previous Awards and Decorations"** tab on the Award Generator page.

## Manage Your Credits

Need more credits? Simply click on either the **"Credits"** button in the left sidebar or the **"Credits Remaining"** button at the top right of your screen. This will take you to a page where you can either:
