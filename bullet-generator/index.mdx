## Create Your Account

To get started, sign in using your Google account or create a new account with your email address.

Once logged in, you'll receive **5 free credits** so you can explore RapidEPR's capabilities and see how it can simplify military performance reports for you. These credits will be displayed in the top right corner of your dashboard, so you can easily track how many you have remaining.

## Generate Your First Bullet

1. From your dashboard, click on the **"Bullet Generator"** option in the left sidebar menu.

2. On the Bullet Generator page, select your **branch of service** from the dropdown menu.

3. In the text box, describe your accomplishment in plain English. No need to worry about military formatting - RapidEPR will take care of that for you!

4. Next, choose the **format** you need for your performance report statement, such as Army NCOER, Air Force EPR, Navy Eval, or USMC FitRep, etc.

5. Choose the **creativity variation** you want to use for your bullet. The less creative option will generate a more concise bullet, while the more creative option will result in a more verbose bullet.

6. Click **"Generate"** and RapidEPR will create a properly formatted bullet based on your input.

That's it! You can view your previously generated bullets anytime by clicking the **"Previous Bullets"** tab on the Bullet Generator page.

## Manage Your Credits

Need more credits? Simply click on either the **"Credits"** button in the left sidebar or the **"Credits Remaining"** button at the top right of your screen. This will take you to a page where you can either:

- Purchase additional credits in packages
- Subscribe to our Pro plan for unlimited credits at $20/month
