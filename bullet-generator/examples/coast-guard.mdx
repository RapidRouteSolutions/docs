## EER Bullet

Designed for the U.S. Coast Guard Enlisted Evaluation Report (EER), this format transforms regular achievements into impactful bullet points. Each bullet, limited to 220 characters, begins with two defining words like "Dynamic Leader" or "Operational Expert." The format emphasizes concise language, leveraging Coast Guard-specific or widely understood abbreviations. Personal pronouns are avoided, and there's a strong focus on quantitative metrics, always connecting achievements to the overarching Coast Guard mission. While the target character count is 220 or less, outputs may occasionally exceed this limit, necessitating further user refinement.

**Example Output:**
