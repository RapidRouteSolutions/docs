## Eval Bullet

Designed specifically for the U.S. Navy Enlisted Evaluation system, this format transforms plain achievements into impactful narrative statements that highlight a Sailor's traits and accomplishments. Outputs aim to fall between 300-400 characters. Each statement starts with a descriptor of the Sailor's trait or role, such as "Dynamic Leader" or "Operational Expert", followed by a clear action and its measurable effect. The format avoids personal pronouns and unfamiliar acronyms, focusing on naval terminology. A key feature is the emphasis on quantitative metrics, always tying achievements back to the wider Navy mission.
