## FITREP Bullet

Optimized for the US Marine Corps' FITREP system, this format emphasizes a Marine's tangible achievements, spotlighting quantifiable contributions to mission objectives and their impact on fellow Marines, equipment, and resources. Outputs are crafted to be succinct, ranging between 150-250 characters. In instances where specific data isn't provided, the system either innovatively generates them or employs placeholders like "xx%" or "xx Marines/equipment/assets" for user customization later.
