# Military Unit Member Guide

This guide provides detailed information for members of military units in RapidEPR. As a unit member, you have access to your unit's credit pool, which can significantly enhance your RapidEPR experience.

## Understanding Unit Membership

### What is a Military Unit in RapidEPR?

A Military Unit in RapidEPR is a virtual representation of your real-world military organization (squadron, detachment, division, etc.) that allows for:

- Shared access to a pool of credits
- Centralized management of resources
- More efficient use of RapidEPR features

### Benefits of Being a Unit Member

As a unit member, you enjoy several advantages:

- **Access to Unit Credits**: Use credits from your unit's pool for generating bullets, awards, and resumes
- **Consistent Access**: Even if your personal credits run out, you can continue using RapidEPR with unit credits
- **Simplified Resource Management**: No need to purchase your own credits if your unit maintains its credit pool

## Getting Started as a Unit Member

### Joining a Unit

You cannot directly join a unit yourself. Instead:

1. A unit administrator must add you using your email address
2. You'll receive notification when you've been added to a unit
3. You must have an existing RapidEPR account
4. You can only belong to one unit at a time

If you're currently a member of a different unit, you'll need to leave that unit before you can be added to a new one.

### Viewing Your Unit Information

To view information about your unit:

1. Log in to your RapidEPR account
2. Navigate to the Units section of your dashboard
3. You'll see your current unit's information, including:
   - Unit name
   - Your role (Member)
   - Current unit credit balance
   - List of unit administrators you can contact for support

## Using RapidEPR as a Unit Member

### Credit Usage

When generating content in RapidEPR:

1. The system automatically checks for available unit credits first
2. If unit credits are available, they will be used before your personal credits
3. If unit credits are depleted, the system falls back to your personal credits
4. If neither are available, you'll be prompted to purchase more credits

### Viewing Credit Sources

When using RapidEPR features, you can always see which credit source is being used:

- The credit indicator will show whether unit or personal credits are being used
- Your dashboard will display both your personal credit balance and your unit's credit balance

### Credit Limitations

Remember that:

- You can only use credits for legitimate military purposes
- Unit administrators can see statistics about your credit usage (but not the actual content you generate)
- Your access to unit credits ends if you leave or are removed from the unit

## Managing Your Unit Membership

### Leaving a Unit

If you need to leave your current unit:

1. Navigate to the Units section of your dashboard
2. Click "Leave Unit" on your unit management view
3. Confirm your decision when prompted

**Important notes about leaving a unit:**

- You will immediately lose access to unit credits
- You can join a different unit after leaving your current one
- Your personal credits remain available for your use
- This action cannot be undoneâ€”you'll need to be re-added by an administrator if you want to rejoin

### Unit Administrator Contact

If you need assistance with your unit membership:

1. Navigate to the Units section of your dashboard
2. View the list of unit administrators and their contact information
3. Reach out to any administrator with questions or issues

## One Unit Policy

### Understanding the One Unit Limitation

RapidEPR limits users to membership in only one unit at a time. This policy:

- Ensures clear credit allocation
- Simplifies unit management
- Prevents confusion about which unit's credits are being used

### Changing Units

If you need to join a different unit:

1. Leave your current unit
2. Ask the administrator of the new unit to add you
3. Once added, you'll have immediate access to the new unit's credits

## Frequently Asked Questions for Members

### What happens to my generated content if I leave a unit?

All content you've generated remains accessible to you, regardless of which credits were used to create it.

### Can I transfer my personal credits to my unit?

No, personal credits and unit credits are separate pools and cannot be transferred.

### Can I see how many credits I've used from the unit pool?

No, only unit administrators can see credit usage statistics. As a member, you can only see the current credit balance of your unit.

### What if my unit runs out of credits?

If your unit's credit pool is depleted, the system will automatically switch to using your personal credits. If you have none available, you'll need to either purchase personal credits or contact your unit administrator about replenishing the unit's credits.

### Can I be in different units for different features (bullets vs. awards)?

No, your unit membership applies to all RapidEPR features. You cannot be in one unit for bullets and another for awards.
