# Military Units

Military Units is a powerful feature in RapidEPR designed for military organizations to efficiently manage and share credits among their members. This feature allows squadrons, detachments, divisions, or other military organizations to centrally administer credit usage and provide consistent access to RapidEPR's tools for all their personnel.

## Overview

The Military Units feature addresses common challenges military organizations face when using RapidEPR:

- **Centralized Credit Management**: Purchase credits in bulk for your entire unit instead of individual purchases
- **Cost Sharing**: Distribute resource costs across your organization
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track how credits are being used across your unit
- **Simplified Access**: Ensure all members have access to the tools they need without individual payment setups

## Key Features

### Unit Management

- **Unit Creation**: Request and establish a dedicated unit for your military organization
- **Member Administration**: Add, remove, and manage unit members
- **Role Assignment**: Designate administrators to help manage the unit
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor credit usage by individual members

### Credit Sharing System

- **Shared Credit Pool**: All unit members draw from the unit's credit allocation
- **Credit Prioritization**: Unit credits are automatically used before personal credits
- **Bulk Discounts**: Purchase credits at reduced rates for your entire unit
- **Unlimited Subscription Option**: Subscribe to an unlimited plan for high-usage units

   - If you need to join a different unit, you must leave your current unit first

2. **Using Unit Credits**:

## Important Policies

### One Unit Per Member

Each user can only belong to one unit at a time. This policy ensures clear credit allocation and management. If you need to join a different unit, you must first leave your current unit.

### Unit Administrator Responsibilities

Unit administrators should be responsible individuals within your organization who will:

- Manage unit membership appropriately
- Monitor credit usage
- Ensure credits are used for legitimate organizational purposes
- Handle administrative tasks like adding/removing members

### Unit Member Limitations

As a unit member:

- You can leave a unit at any time (unless you're an administrator)
- Administrators must transfer their admin role before leaving
- After leaving, you'll no longer have access to unit credits
- Your personal credits remain available for your use

## FAQ about Military Units

### Who can create a unit?

Anyone with a RapidEPR account can request to create a unit. Requests are reviewed to ensure they're for legitimate military organizations. Upon approval, the requestor becomes the initial unit administrator.

### How many members can a unit have?

There's no hard limit on unit size. Units can have as many members as needed to support your military organization.

### What happens if our unit runs out of credits?

If your unit exhausts its credit pool, members will automatically start using their personal credits. Unit administrators will receive notifications when credit levels are low.

### Can unit administrators see what members are generating?

No. While administrators can see credit usage statistics (how many credits used for bullets, awards, or resumes), they cannot see the actual content being generated. This preserves individual privacy.

### How do we cancel a unit subscription?

Unit administrators can cancel a subscription from the unit management page. The subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period.
