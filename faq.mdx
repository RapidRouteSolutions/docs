## What is RapidEPR?

RapidEPR is a web application designed to convert plain English descriptions into properly formatted performance report bullets for all branches of the U.S. military. Its mission is to streamline the bullet writing process by producing precise and compelling bullets based on user-inputted accomplishments.

## This used to be free...what happened?

I wanted to keep this service free for everyone, and I attempted to do so by placing ads on the site. However, all ads were being blocked on government networks, where the majority of RapidEPR traffic occurs. Due to this, I was incurring a significant financial loss out of my own pocket. I had to make a decision: either shut down the site or charge a small fee to cover the costs of running the site. I chose the latter, and I hope you understand. I'm still committed to keeping the cost as low as possible, and I hope you continue to use RapidEPR.

## How much does it cost to use RapidEPR?

RapidEPR offers two flexible pricing options:

1. **Pay-as-you-go**: Purchase credits in packages to use as needed. Each user gets 5 free credits to start.
2. **Pro Subscription**: For $20/month, you get unlimited credits and priority support.

Please refer to the **Credits Page** for a detailed breakdown of costs and features.

## What are Military Units in RapidEPR?

Military Units are a feature designed for squadrons, detachments, divisions, or other military organizations to share credits among their members. This allows unit administrators to centrally manage and distribute credits to all members efficiently.

## How do Military Units work?

- **Unit Creation**: Military units can be created through a request process. Once approved, a unit administrator can manage members and credits.
- **Credit Sharing**: All members of a unit share the unit's credit pool, which is automatically used before individual credits.
- **Credit Plans**: Units can purchase credit packages at bulk discounted rates or subscribe to an unlimited plan.
- **Membership Management**: Unit administrators can add or remove members and promote members to administrators.
- **Usage Tracking**: Unit administrators can view detailed credit usage by each member.

## Can I belong to multiple units?

No, each user can only belong to one unit at a time. If you need to join a different unit, you must first leave your current unit. This ensures clear credit allocation and management.

## How do I leave a unit?

If you're a regular member (not an administrator), you can leave a unit at any time from the unit management page. Unit administrators must first transfer their admin role to another member before they can leave.

## What happens to my credits when I leave a unit?

When you leave a unit, you'll no longer have access to the unit's credit pool. However, your personal credits remain available for your use. Any features you were using with unit credits will start using your personal credits instead.

## Can I join a different unit after leaving one?

Yes, after leaving a unit, you can join a different unit if you receive an invitation from that unit's administrator. Remember that you can only belong to one unit at a time.

## How do I request a new unit?

You can request to create a new unit from the Units page. You'll need to provide information about your military organization and explain why you need a unit. Once approved, you'll automatically become the unit's administrator.

## Who should be a unit administrator?

Unit administrators should typically be individuals in leadership or administrative positions within the military organization who are responsible for managing resources. They will have full control over unit membership and can view credit usage data.

## Can I provide feedback or ask questions about RapidEPR?

Absolutely, feedback and inquiries are always welcome. Please visit the _Contact Page_ to submit any thoughts or questions. Responses will be provided as promptly as possible.

## What should I do if the generated bullet needs modification?

RapidEPR offers an excellent foundation for bullet creation, but it's understood that refinements may be needed to accurately represent unique situations. Users are encouraged to edit the output as necessary to best showcase their accomplishments. Directly copying the generated bullet without modifications is not recommended.

## How can I ensure the best results when using RapidEPR?

For optimal results, users are advised to provide specific details about their accomplishments when using RapidEPR. This includes the scope of involvement, the impact of actions, and any quantifiable data that highlights the significance of the achievement.

## Are my payments secure?

Yes, your payments are secure. All transactions are handled by Stripe, a trusted and secure payment platform. No payment data is stored on the RapidEPR servers, ensuring your information remains protected.

## How do credits work?

Credits are used each time you submit an entry for translation:

- 1 credit per bullet point
- 3 credits per award citation

If you prefer unlimited access, consider our Pro subscription plan which provides unlimited credits for a monthly fee.
